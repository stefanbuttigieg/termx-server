This would be similar to where the Entity being referenced is managed outside FHIR, such as through HL7 V2, v3, or XDS. This might be where the Entity being referenced is managed in another FHIR resource server. Thus it explains the Provenance of that Entity's use in the context of this Provenance activity.",

This would be similar to where the Entity being referenced is managed outside FHIR, such as through HL7 V2, v3, or XDS. This might be where the Entity being referenced is managed in another FHIR resource server. Thus it explains the Provenance of that Entity's use in the context of this Provenance activity.",
